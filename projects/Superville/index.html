    <!--Text Paragraph-->

    <p class="Paragraph">
        The surrounding side valleys of Tyrol
        are increasingly struggling with an
        exodus of the population. Business and
        industry are shifting almost entirely
        to the Inn Valley. This has resulted in
        a reduction in the cultural care of the
        Lech Valley, because only where land
        is used, it is also adequately cared for.
        However, the topographical conditions
        in the Lech Valley require particularly
        intensive landscape maintenance. This
        is because there is a particularly high
        density of avalanches and floods.
        This project shows how the Lech Valley
        could continue to be preserved as an
        attractive and productive landscape.
        Natural occurrence of medicinal plants
        is rapidly decreasing. In addition,
        synthesis of some natural drugs is not
        possible until today. Through cultivation
        roboter and intelligent temporary
        drying shells, natural plants could be
        cultivated and serve a new purpose in
        the Lechtal valley.
        The Lechtal Limestone Alps have
        particularly suitable conditions for their
        cultivation. Essential factors are soil
        quality, water conditions, exposure of
        the steep slopes and their machinability,
        logical divisions of the fields and their
        planting result. The drying shells retain
        their temporary character. As such
        they preserve living space for future
        population in a productive way.
